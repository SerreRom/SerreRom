I'm the co-founder and CTO of PulsivIT. I work mainly on Microsoft Azure and I love make deployments by using GitHub and Terraform. I'm also a Micosoft Most Valuable Professional (MVP) for almost 10 years now (I started in Hyper-V category and now I'm in Cloud & Hybrid Solution). I like also to work on security espacially on Microsoft Entra.
